## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
If I give up I will never learn, it's better to try and fail and grow than to never try at all.
Struggle is not a failure, it is part of learning and bettering oneself.
2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
I demonstrate a growth mindset by not letting myself succumb to setbacks and issues, pushing through to try and solve my problems.
I don't demonstrate a growth mindset because I still struggle to tap into my classmates for help.
3. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
conditional statements are switches that activate in the program when the conditions set by the statement are met
```ruby
if variable == 0
if variable == true || false
if variable == "string"
```
4. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
to allow a program to react to input from the user
5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
```ruby
if variable == 1
  puts "1 is the integer"
end
```
6. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
elsif
7. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
```Ruby
if variable == integer
  puts "string"
elsif variable == true
  puts "string"
else 
  puts "string"
end
```
